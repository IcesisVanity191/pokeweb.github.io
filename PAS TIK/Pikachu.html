<h2>Pikachu</h2>
<p>Pikachu (Japanese: Pikachu) is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.
In Alola, Pikachu evolves into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.
Pikachu has sixteen other forms that fall into four groups: Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Gigantamax Pikachu. Ordinary Pikachu can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Pikachu if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Additionally, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media.
Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Pikachu with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve. The starter Pikachu from Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file. Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and one of Nintendo's major mascots. It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon of Pokémon Yellow and Let's Go, Pikachu!, is the starter Pokémon of Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World, and has made numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.</p>

<p>Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs. In the anime, it has been shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. The anime has also shown that Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pokémon species. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In the manga, it has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant. While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter.</p>
