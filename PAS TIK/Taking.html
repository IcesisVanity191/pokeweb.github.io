<h2>Taking Over Japan & The World</h2>
<p>The first Pokemon games, Pokemon Red and Green Versions, came to the Nintendo Game Boy system in Japan on February 27, 1996, which was the fulfillment of Satoshi Tajiri's dream and allowed people of all ages to catch, train and trade 151 creatures and become a Pokemon Master.</p>
<p>Initially, the Pokemon games had modest sales. However, after players discovered Mew in the games, the magazine CoroCoro announced a "Legendary Pokemon Offer" to distribute Mew to twenty entrants. The contest received 78,000 entrants, and the sales of the Pokemon games quickly increased. Due to high sales, Pokemon Red and Green were swiftly followed up with Pokemon Blue, which had improved graphics and sounds.</p>

<p>Due to Pokemon's success in Japan, the series was released overseas. Before the games were released in North America, the localization team attempted to change the Pokemon designs, fearing that the cute designs would not appeal to western gamers; however, the proposal was refused. On the other hand, Nintendo originally did not intend to allow for localized Pok√©mon names (due to having to register more trademarks), but were eventually convinced by the French translation team to do so. North America received Red and Blue Versions, as well as the anime, in September 1998 (the anime on the 7th and the games on the 28th), and soon everywhere else began to play the games on the Game Boy under the slogan Gotta Catch 'em All!. The Trading Card Game was also introduced to North America on January 9, 1999 by Wizards of the Coast. The Electric Tale of Pikachu became the first Pokemon manga to be translated to English when VIZ Media started publishing it on September 28, 1999.</p>
